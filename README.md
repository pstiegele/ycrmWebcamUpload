# ycrmWebcamUpload
Python script running on a pi handling ycrm.de ftp webcam image upload

This script is uploading new webcam images out of the local ftp space up to the ycrm.de webspace. To define new webcam images or change the paths just edit the files variable

## Hint
If python error occurs that host key is missing: just connect once manually per ssh to server, save host key and thats it

## Todo
- notify if offline upload occurs
- create notification if uploads occurs with an delay lesser than 90s
